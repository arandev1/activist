        Why is Equality Important
      </h2>

      <p>
        <!-- TODO: Update the text with your own -->

        Throughout history, the struggle of equality within society has persisted.
        Each generation has played a role in bridging the gap of these right. In 1920, 
        the 19th Amendement was a pivotal point in society, finally allowing women
        to vote because of the rise of activism and awareness from groups like the Silent Sentinels. 
        Despite efforts like this, there are still prevalent social issues regarding racism
        and women's rights and a society can only move forward and progress with unity. Unity comes from 
        bridging these gaps and addressing these problems.

        Women & Equality
      </h2>
          Abortion
      <p>
        <!-- TODO: Update the text with your own -->
Established by Magaret Sanger, Planned Parenthood allowed women to 
        recieve abortions in safety as well as access numerous 
        resources such as birth control. With this, women gained the right 
        over their own bodies and this was another step towards equality 
        for women in society. HOWEVER, in recent times, abortion has become 
        a very debatable topic and some people want to ban the right to an abortion. 
        There are many flaws with this as women will resort to more dangerous 
        ways if abortion is banned and ultimately, it is the woman's personal 
        matter and freedom to have the option of abortion. If one does not support abortion, 
        they don't have to get one, but revoking someone else's ability to get one
        is not anyone's business except theirs.

        Race & Equality

      <p>
        <!-- TODO: Update the text with your own -->

        Following women, there is a gap that needs to be address with 
        races & equality. One issue we see today in society is the rise of 
        sterotypes around particular races/ethnicities.

        Stereotypes & Jokes
      </h2>
              
      <p>
        <!-- TODO: Update the text with your own -->

        Sterotype: Having an idea/judgement of a type of person. Often times, this means that 
        people such as strangers will already have a perception of you. Race
        plays a factor into that perception. Often times, "jokes" around a race and stereotypes
        can often contribute to negative effects even if it seems harmless. 
        For example, Covid-19 wasn't the only problem that spread around. Stereotypes & "jokes" about asians 
        were made. For example, the use of "Chinese virus" as called by some who might not have had 
        bad intentions, led to a surge in hate crimes against Asians. The same people that say "jokes" like this 
        are harmless are the same people that fail to recognize the effects and consequences it has on 
        real people.
