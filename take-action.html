         To start, you can look for the biases and stereotypes you might 
        already have and percieve of other races. Knowing that just because 
          a person is of a race, does not mean that they fit into the idea
          that you percieve them in. Don't be afraid to call 
          people out when you hear stereotypes perpetuating racism. Additionally, 
          it's important to be educated on the other issues women face such as the
          right to the choice of abortion. If you'd like to further your knowledge on
          the inequality women face in society, there are plenty of other resources
          to check out in addition!
